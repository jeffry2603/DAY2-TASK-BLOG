Window object and Document object are not same.
Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
The Document Object Â of a web page is created by the browser when it is loaded. The document object displays the whole HTML document as an object tree (HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). 
The HTML document is represented by the root element.
The window object represents a window or tab that has a DOM document loaded in it, and the document object is a property of the window object that points to that document.
You may use the window.document property to access a document object or you can use the document object directly as the window.
